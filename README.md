Interactive DSA Problems: Practice a variety of coding problems designed to enhance your problem-solving skills.
LeetCode-Style Questions: Engage with problems modeled after those found on LeetCode, preparing you for real-world coding interviews.
Courses: Explore in-depth courses on various DSA topics, all created and curated by the developer.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.JS for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
Backend: Powered by Firebase, which handles authentication, real-time data management, and other backend functionalities.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and improves code quality throughout the application.


Known Issues
Add language support: Allow problem solving in C++ and Python
Firebase Knowledge: Limited experience with Firebase resulted in some challenges during development. Future updates will aim to address these issues and enhance the application's backend functionalities.
